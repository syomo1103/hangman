# Project 1: Hangman 

## Description

**Hangman** is a typically a paper and pencil guessing game. We're putting a spin on it and taking it to the web! 

The word to guess is represented by a row (or rows) of dashes, where each dash represents a letter in the word. If the player guesses a correct letter, the letter populates in all its correct positions. If the player's guess is incorrect, one element of a hanged man stick figure (I know, **morbid**) gets drawn in as a tally mark. 

If the word is complete before the hangman stick figure, you win! If not, don't beat yourself up about it - you can try again.

1. Adding complexity to words after each win
2. Add option to exit current game at any point 
3. Allow one player to create the word and pass to a friend to play together.
