# Project 1: Hangman 

## Description

>>>> A description of your game ([Use Your Game's Name]). Background info of the game and screenshots are a nice touch.

**Hangman** is a typically a paper and pencil guessing game. We're putting a spin on it and taking it to the web! 

The word to guess is represented by a row (or rows) of dashes, where each dash represents a letter in the word. If the player guesses a correct letter, the letter populates in all its correct positions. If the player's guess is incorrect, one element of a hanged man stick figure (I know, **morbid**) gets drawn in as a tally mark. 

If the word is complete before the hangman stick figure, you win! If not, don't beat yourself up about it - you can try again.
